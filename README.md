# Voting system

A small organization, decided to use a new vote system, during meetings.  
All voters are known to the organization and are whitelisted using their Ethereum address.   
They can submit new proposals during a proposal registration session, and can vote on proposals only during the voting session.  
When the administrator, has tally the votes, the vote is closed.

Few rules:  
✔️ Voting is not secret for users added to the Whitelist.  
✔️ Each voter can see the votes of others.  
✔️ The winner is determined by simple majority.  
✔️ The proposal that gets the most votes wins.
